## 🌸 About Me

Hi 👋 I’m Meghanshi Mathur  

I’m passionate about building intelligent systems using Machine Learning and Computer Vision.  
I enjoy experimenting with deep learning models, feature extraction techniques, and real-world image processing pipelines.

I like transforming ideas into working projects — from CNN image classifiers to segmentation models and classical CV pipelines.

My focus areas include:

- Computer Vision & Image Processing  
- Deep Learning (CNNs, Segmentation)  
- Feature Detection & Descriptors  
- Model experimentation & visualization  
- Python-based ML workflows  

I believe in learning by building — every project here reflects hands-on practice and continuous improvement.
